        A Report to Friends is our annual publication sharing updates on completed projects, as well as current and future opportunities. Additionally, the Report To Friends features stories from active Board of Directors members, as well as friends of Moldova World Childrenâ€™s Fund that traveled to Moldova on various trips and projects. Each visit is unique in scope and accomplishments. We hope that you share these with your friends and family</h5>
